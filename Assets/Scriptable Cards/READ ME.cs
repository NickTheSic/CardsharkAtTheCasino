//NOT A REAL CLASS


/*
 * 
 * If you want to add cards it is easy
 * 
 * Right click and create new, at the top you will see 'card'
 * 
 * Name the card the upgrade name
 * 
 * Click and then in the inspector you just need to fill in the information about the card you added
 * 
 * Don't worry about the Upgrade number yet, I can fill that in. It might not need one depending on what we plan
 * 
 * I can add it in later
